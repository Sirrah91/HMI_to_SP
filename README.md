# HMI_to_SP

The project aims to upscale and deconvolve SDO/HMI data to match the resolution and quality of Hinode/SOT-SP data, particularly focusing on continuum intensity and the vector magnetic field in the local reference frame.

For more details about a specific version, please see the corresponding README.
